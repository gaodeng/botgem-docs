## Privacy and Security

### Is my data secure when using BotGem?

BotGem takes data security seriously. We do not store any of your conversation data on our servers. All your data remains on your device. When using local models with Ollama, your data never even leaves your device to reach external AI providers.

### Does BotGem share my prompts or conversations with third parties?

BotGem does not share your prompts or conversations with third parties. However, when you use external AI providers (like OpenAI or Anthropic), your prompts are sent to their servers and are subject to their privacy policies.

### Can I delete my conversation history?

Yes, you can delete individual conversations or clear your entire conversation history from the settings menu.

## Billing and Subscription

### How does billing work for API usage?

API usage is billed directly by the AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) based on their pricing models. BotGem does not charge for API usage but provides a convenient interface to access these services.

### How do I manage my Pro purchase?

After purchasing the Pro version, it will be automatically activated on your device. For mobile versions, your purchase is linked to your app store account.

### Is the Pro version a recurring payment?

No, the Pro version is a one-time purchase, not a subscription. Once you buy it, you own it permanently with no recurring fees.

## Troubleshooting

### Why am I getting an "API Key Invalid" error?

This error typically occurs when:
- Your API key is entered incorrectly
- Your API key has expired
- Your API key has insufficient credits
- The API service is experiencing issues

Verify your API key in the provider's dashboard and ensure you have sufficient credits.
